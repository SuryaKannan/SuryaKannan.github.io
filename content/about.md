Hi, I'm Surya.

I'm a software engineer based in Melbourne, Australia.

I love all things software! These days i'm diving into the realm of agents and solving very interesting problems at an enterprise scale. Most of my work is done in Python and Typescript, but I am trying to get my hands dirty with Java too!

I'm interested in creating scalable distributed systems, cloud and keeping up with the latest advancements in the world of tech.
