## VibeCoding 
*Written by Gene Kim and Steve Yegge*

Actually got this for free when I went to a workshop hosted by the authors. Key takeaways I got from this were that AI tooling is here to stay and software engineering is transforming before our very eyes. We need to become proficient with this new tooling (Claude Code ftw) and move our focus from writing boilerplate to instead understanding software design patterns and how to design systems. All in all, excited to see what the future holds and this book makes me optimistic.
